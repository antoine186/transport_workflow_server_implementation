# How to run the setup for testing
## Please use VSCode debugging (instructions included here) as otherwise the setup might not work as intended

! flask_base_server is the 3rd party server provided as part of this task
! flask_proxy_server is the server that I built to interact with the provided 3rd party server.
You should only test flask_proxy_server.

* Install VSCode and open flask_base_server using VSCode.
* In VSCode, do CTRL+SHIFT+D. Press on the play button that appears on the left (not the one on the right).

* Separately, open flask_proxy_server using VSCode.
* Once again in VSCode, do CTRL+SHIFT+D. Press on the play button that appears on the left (not the one on the right).
